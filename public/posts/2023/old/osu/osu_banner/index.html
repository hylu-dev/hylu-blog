Linear ring - Enchanted love\n@karmabethe pic.twitter.com/9nUHgIcG5u\n— BigheadCrusher (@bigheadcrusher) January 2, 2022 From my previous artwork, I already had a lot of the patterns created as well as familiarity with the style so it really was a process of just stamping around different shapes and decorations until I liked it.\nOnce the main banner was done, I exported them in layers so I can seperate out where I want the foreground and backgrounds to be in relation to the animated characters.\nLayering into Blender With those exported, I moved on to organizing them into Blender. It took me a while to realize that just importing them is as images wasn’t going to render. Turns out, pure image objects are more for reference than anything. Instead, I needed to create an actual object in Blender and have the image on it as a texture. Luckily Blender has a nifty addon to import images directly as plane objects which will render.\nHowever, I had a lot of trouble getting images as planes to show up because in my original project, I forgot I removed the world lighting entirely, so any objects with just the base shaders would just render black with no light. Once I realized this, I had to create a new shader. It seemed simple enough by just plugging in the image color directly into the material output but I forgot about the transparent parts of the images, they would also just render black this way. I managed a solution by mixing the image colors with a transparent shader and deciding when to mix into transparent based on the alpha channel of the image.
