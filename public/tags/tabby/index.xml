      <description>Today is my first official day of class attending the Advanced Programming program at Sheridan College.
To commemorate this, I&amp;rsquo;ve reorganized my whole directory structure for this blog to be organized by year and month rather than sub topics. I&amp;rsquo;ve been finding the subtopic folders to be growing far to fast (particularly the dev folder) to keep posting all in one place.
This way, my working directory is ever only so large for each month and I&amp;rsquo;m also relieved of the duty of figuring out which folder I should be making my post in.</description>
