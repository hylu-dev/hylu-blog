      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s so many components to game development I want to learn about and the more I dig in, the more I feel like this hole of knowledge is neverending. It&amp;rsquo;s also the fact that there&amp;rsquo;s so much technology that&amp;rsquo;s already been built and currently being built by people leagues ahead in expertise that it feels like a waste to start at anything only for it to be phased out by some new fangled technology.</description>
