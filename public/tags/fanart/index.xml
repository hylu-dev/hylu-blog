      <description>Journey into a Beatmap Getting Started After doing my first fanart, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any intention of doing another but this one&amp;rsquo;s theme instantly gave me the idea of incorporating 3D modelling into the art piece. In summary, the theme is to create an Osu fanart with the OC&amp;rsquo;s inside a beatmap.
I immediately had the idea of drawing Enchanted Love as I fell in love with the visuals from the original MV.</description>

      <description>osu! Fanarts? Osu holds several fanart contest every year with themes often related to the time of year. Themes such as Winter or Halloween are such examples. Regardless of theme, the general idea seems to always be to draw any of the osu mascots inside or partaking in said theme.
At the time I had been playing osu for about 4 months and really enjoying it. On the other hand, I&amp;rsquo;ve been drawing casually for a few years as a hobby so it seemed naturally to want to give these contests a shot.</description>
