      <description>Warframe recently released it&amp;rsquo;s long awaited update, The Duviri Paradox. I&amp;rsquo;ve been silently waiting for it&amp;rsquo;s release since it&amp;rsquo;s been talked about and delayed for many years. I played some and overall and I feel like I could pretty well enjoy it if not for the bugs. I think the push for slower paced gameplay is cool but just doesn&amp;rsquo;t really have a future with the rest of Warframe. I was a little disappointed how this really ends up as a huge, sectioned off experience with little impact on the rest of the game.</description>
