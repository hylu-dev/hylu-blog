      <description>A couple years ago I made a little extension for chrome to organize and sort tabs by url domains. It was really quick and crudely designed and since I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even a Chrome user, I didn&amp;rsquo;t think too much about improving it. Fast forward to now, I decided to do exactly that.
Looking at old code Actually the code was mostly better than I expected, other than some variable naming and redundant lines, I didn&amp;rsquo;t see much need to rewrite it.</description>
