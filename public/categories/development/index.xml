      <description>Now that I&amp;rsquo;m starting on Slime Hunter, I figured I should get back to using some project management tools. In particular, Kanban boards as they are simple to manage and don&amp;rsquo;t come with nearly as much fluff as something like Jira issue tracking systems. The nice thing as well is that there&amp;rsquo;s so many great project management tools out there. In this case, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to use Trello as I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with Atlassian tools (again Jira) so I feel comfortable continuing to use their products.</description>
