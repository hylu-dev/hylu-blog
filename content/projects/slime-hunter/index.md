## Slime Hunter

**Slime Hunter** is a *3D Top-Down Action RPG* set in the fantasy world of **Slimeria**, where players hunt cute and dangerous slimes. Featuring comprehensive combat, spell, and inventory systems, diverse enemies, and a beautifully hand-built environment.

> Slimeria is a fantasy world where Slimes are the primary fauna alongside humans. For mysterious reasons, the slime population has grown significantly while more dangerous breeds wreaking havoc on local towns. You play a lone slime hunter, making their journey through Slimeria to learn about the state of the slime invasion and hopefully find the source.
