There's so many components to game development I want to learn about and the more I dig in, the more I feel like this hole of knowledge is neverending. It's also the fact that there's so much technology that's already been built and currently being built by people leagues ahead in expertise that it feels like a waste to start at anything only for it to be phased out by some new fangled technology.

Though, the more I look into the games that impress me the more I realize that development is full of creative ideas made on the fly and strong problem solving skills.

That's why I thought it'd be a good idea to start on a simple game engine to really give myself a good baseline of fundamentals and test my understanding and hopefully hone them into memory.
