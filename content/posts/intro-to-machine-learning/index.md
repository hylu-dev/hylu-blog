In preparation for a deep learning course I'm taking over the Summer, I'm taking a short [intro course on machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_LwzRVP7bg) to help prepare me for some of the fundamental concepts.
I've been avoiding AI for a while but given its ongoing application in nearly everything now, I figure it's more than worth getting my feet wet.

## ML Overview

### Types of Machine Learning

**Supervised Learning** - Using labelled input data to train models, e.g. inputting animal pictured labelled with the coorresponding animal names.
**Unsupervised Leraning** - Using unlabelled input data to learn about pattern in data, e.g. inputting unlabelled animal pictures and having your machine try to group them
**Reinforcement Learning** = Agent learning in an environment based on rewards and penalties
