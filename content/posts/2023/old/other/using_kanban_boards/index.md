Now that I'm starting on Slime Hunter, I figured I should get back to using some project management tools. In particular, Kanban boards as they are simple to manage and don't come with nearly as much fluff as something like Jira issue tracking systems. The nice thing as well is that there's so many great project management tools out there. In this case, I've decided to use Trello as I'm familiar with Atlassian tools (again Jira) so I feel comfortable continuing to use their products. There also an industry standard in this field and I expect to continue on for many years. There are definitely are tools out there that might fit the simplicity I need much better given there size, I don't want to worry about the chance that may lack software maintenance or one day just disappear altogether.

While the obvious benefits of having a more organized workflow is clear, I personally value it most for keeping the mentality of **"one step at a time"**. Getting a project going takes a long time and it can feel like nothings coming together as you continue to hammer out pieces of it with no discernable progress being made. Splitting up small tasks on a Kanban board and completing them, no matter how trivial the tasks is, you have something palpable you can consider "done". It's a nice mental reminder that you have done something today and a reminder of all that you've done the days before.
