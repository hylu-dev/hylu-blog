I've been thinking about drawing more casually, inspired by how others seem to sketch just for the joy of it, not tied to contests or big projects. I really admire how they just go with whatever they're feeling, letting their ideas spill onto the page without worrying about a specific style. I've tried a few doodles myself, and it's kind of neat to see them starting to share a certain look, even if I'm not sure what it means yet.

I've always found it tricky to figure out my own styleâ€”every time I draw, I end up trying something different, like I'm still searching for what feels right. But there's something nice about these low-pressure sketches.
