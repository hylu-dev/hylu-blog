I've been trying to get into the habit of drawing casually as opposed to doing so as part of some contest or project. Part of that is just drawing what I feel in the moment. I'm not intending to follow any style but at the same time I'm not stopping myself from easing any habits which resulted with a few pictures that do share a style. I always felt with drawing that I have no clue what my style is. For instance, everytime I play Gartic Phone, I tend to do something different each time and I don't find myself easing into any one method. Perhaps more casual art does a better job at bringing out the characteristics of my drawing.
