It's been a while since I've done a post. Honestly, I've been hitting a bit of a slum. I have things I want to accomplish and a way towards it but every step in that direction feels so heavy. I am indulging in avoidance and everyday it eats at me because I know I can do better--I've done better.

What is it that I want to do? I want to make something of my own and share it to people who know why.

Again, I'm so focused on what I'd to do that I forgot to "just do". Find my own way, find my own method, find my own essence. I know it exists amongst all of what I love yet I keep refusing to grab it. Rather than refusing, maybe it'd be more accurate to say that I'm terrified of it. I'm scared of seeing who I am.

The truth is there's no way to realize my goals without realizing the present and that's what I'm so afraid of. I'm so afraid.

It'll be okay.

I've done a bit.

Don't make a tiny step make the next step look tinier.
